        <h2>What is the Purpose of a Credit or Debit Card?</h2>
        <p>Credit & debit cards have been replacing paper money in many Western Families. 
        They are used to do many things such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Buy day-to-day items</li>
          <li>Complete large transactions</li>
          <li>Make purchases online</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The use of credit cards can be traced back to the early 1920s 
        in the United States when large oil companies would use them to send gas to auto 
        customers. The ancestor of a modern day credit card used to only be accepted by 
        merchants, but eventually during the late 1930s, companies would use
        others' credit cards. In 1958, the Bank of America created <i>BankAmericard</i> which 
        was essentially the first modern-day credit card.</p>

        <h2>Mastercard: Reducing the Amount of PVC in their Credit Cards</h2>
        <p>The production of plastic credit cards uses lots of carbon dioxide and PVC, 
        of which the usage of has a negative effect on the environment. 
        Six and a half billion credit cards were produced in 2017, and around 20.5 
        billion credit cards are in circulation around the world. 
        The average credit card weighs 5.07 grams, where the carbon footprint of a card
        is around 21 grams, including the water and energy that is used to produce one. 
        Additionally, the overall carbon footprint of the 6.5 billion cards produce in 2017 
        is around 136,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide. 
        Credit card companies were not too pleased with these facts. 
        That is why Mastercard recently partnered with card manufacturers in Gemalto, 
        Giesecke+Devrient, and IDEMIA to cut down the use of PVC in their cards. 
        This new partnership will turn the tide in the usage of PVC. 
        The use of PVC grows each year by 3%. Since these numbers are so large and 
        overwhelming, Mastercard has also announced that they will start to produce 
        cards made from plastic debris from ocean waters. Mastercard is just one company, 
        many others are also starting to modify their cards as to cause less harm to the 
        environment.</p>
