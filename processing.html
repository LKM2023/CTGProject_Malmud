        <h2>Design of a Credit/Debit Card</h2>
        <p><span class="select4">Since credit cards are used</span> in many large transactions, and contain 
        personal information about their owners, they must have many security precautions. 
        There are many key design pieces:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The card's account number</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is the piece of information needed to complete a transaction</li>
            <li>Therefore, this information must be protected</li>
            <li>Each customer has their own unique number, each company has 
            a different length, from 13 to 20 numbers, allowing for one billion unique numbers</li>
            <li>The unique number of a credit card makes it difficult to commit fraud</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The signature panel</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The owner's signature documents the owner's handwriting</li>
            <li>The panel has a specail erasure feature that documents finger prints</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A magnetic stripe</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The magnetic stripe is coated in particles of iron oxide that contain 
            binary data</li>
            <li>The information that is stored on these stripes is not known to the general public, 
            because companies do not want it known</li>

      <div id="s3" class="d">
        <h2>Production of Raw Materials</h2>
        <p>The primary manufacturing material of credit/debit cards is 
        <span class="select1">polyvinyl chloride.</span> PVC is mainly exported from the United States, 
        33 billion tons are produced each year. PVC is processed from ethylene 
        dichloride, which is derived from combining chlorine (from sea salt) and 
        ethylene, which comes from <strong>petroleum.</strong> The ethylene dichloride is them 
        decomposed by a high amount of heat and is then polymerized to create PVC. </p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="s4" class="e">
        <h2>Plastic Compounding & Molding</h2>
        <p>The core of a credit card is made by melting and 
        stirring polyvinyl chloride acetate with other preservatives. 
        The mixed ingredients are moved to an <i class="select2">extrusion molding apparatus</i> 
        that makes the molten plastic move into a flat opening, or 
        orifice, also known as a die, and as the sheet emerges from the 
        press it goes through a series of three rollers stacked on each 
        other and keep the sheet a proper thickness. The sheets then go through more cooling units and then are cut into sheets by saws, 
        shears or hot wires. The sliced sheets then enter a stacker that organizes them 
        into the appropriate piles for subsequent operations.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="s5" class="f">
        <h2>Printing</h2>
        <p>The plastic core of the card needs to be printed with texts and graphics. 
        this proces is done with multiple silkscreen processes. Additionally, 
        One of the laminate films might also go through more operations where it is printed with magnetic ink. 
        The magnetic strip then can be joined by a <span class="select3">hot stamping press.</span> After printing, the 
        core is ready to be laminated.</p>

      <div id="s6" class="b">
        <h2>Lamination</h2>
        <p>Lamination protects the card and increases it's strength. 
        The core is sent through a system of rollers; laminate is stocked above and below the card. 
        The laminates are then sent into the vacuum along with the core; the vacuum holds the three 
        pieces of plastic together as they travel to a tacking station. 
        At the tacking station, quartz infrared heat lamps warm both layers of the laminate. 
        The lamps have reflectors that direct and
        focus their energy onto a narrow area which allows for the cleanest bonding of the 
        two materials. They are fully bonded with metal platens that have a heat of <span class="select1">266 degrees Fahrenheit/130 degrees 
        Celsius</span> and are pressed into the card with a pressure of <span class="select2">166 psi/square inch;</span> 
        the process can take 3 minutes.</p>

        </dl>
        <p>After lamination, the sheets are cut by assemblies. 
        Each assembly gets a sheet which is cut into 63 credit cards. Then, the cards 
        are embossed with account numbers and prepared for shipping, often attached to 
        a paper letter with an adhesive</p>
